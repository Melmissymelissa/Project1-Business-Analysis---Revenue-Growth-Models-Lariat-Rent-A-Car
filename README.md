## Introduction
This project focused on conducting a robust business analysis for a (fictional company) Lariat Rent-A-Car, a leading car rental company. By analyzing historical sales data using Excel tools like VLookUp, pivot tables, and t-tests, we provided valuable insights.

I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify strategic scenarios for revenue growth. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) determined the effectiveness of these scenarios. My resulting revenue growth models showcased a 20% increase in profits, while controlling operational costs.

Armed with comprehensive analysis and advanced Excel techniques, this project enables Lariat Rent-A-Car to make data-driven decisions, implement effective strategies, and achieve revenue growth and improved profitability.

## Data

The dataset used for this data analysis project consists of four Excel workbooks provided by Lariat, the national rental car company. Each workbook contains specific information related to the rental car fleet, costs, revenue, and branch locations. Here's a brief description of each workbook:

1. Car Revenue: contains data on the revenue generated by the rental car fleet. It includes details on the car ID, how long the car was rented, price per day, and other factors that contribute to the revenue stream.
