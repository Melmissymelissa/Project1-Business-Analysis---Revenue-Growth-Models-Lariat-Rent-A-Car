## Introduction
This project focused on conducting a robust business analysis for a (fictional company) Lariat Rent-A-Car, a leading car rental company. By analyzing historical sales data using Excel tools like VLookUp, pivot tables, and t-tests, we provided valuable insights.

I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify strategic scenarios for revenue growth. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) determined the effectiveness of these scenarios. My resulting revenue growth models showcased a 20% increase in profits, while controlling operational costs.

Armed with comprehensive analysis and advanced Excel techniques, this project enables Lariat Rent-A-Car to make data-driven decisions, implement effective strategies, and achieve revenue growth and improved profitability.
